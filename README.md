# DARTScraper

- `scraper.py` is used to scrape the data. It probably doesn't have good code practices, because I am incredibly inexperienced with BS4.
- `AnalysisDART.Rmd` is the R markdown file that contains the analysis (which is probably half-wrong because I am also incredibly inexperienced at statistics)
- `AnalysisDART.md` is the markdown file that allows you to view the RMD on GitHub.
- `DART.csv` is the actual data
- `figure-gfm` contains the figures needed for the MD file.
