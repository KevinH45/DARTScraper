# DARTScraper

I have data on all finished debates (columns mentioned below) in a CSV format. Send me a PM with your email if you want it (or you can figure out another way). I also have some graphs and analysis I did with R, if you want that, tell me as well.

I used a (VERY simple) BS4 based webscraper to scrape debate "stat" data from ALL finished debates. This stat data is the stuff you see under a debate in the debate list:
- Amount of arguments (7/8, 2/2, 6/6)
- Amount of comments
- Amount of votes



The specific columns are:
- Completed Arguments
- Total Arguments
- Proportion of Arguments
- Comments
- Votes


There were a few interesting things I found:
- The mean of votes on debates that have a forfeit is double the number of votes on debates that don't have a forfeit.
- A majority of debates have at least one forfeit.
- Zero-vote debates make up 6% of all debates.
- The largest number of comments on a single debate is 384. The largest number of votes on a single debate is 27.
- I suck at statistics (and R)
